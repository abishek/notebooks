# Python Notebooks

I work on Natural Language Processing in my free time. It is something I've grown very curious and interested about in the last couple of years. This repo will host all the notebooks I use to practice my learning. I'll add in all my datasets whenever they are small enough to add to git. Or I'll add a link to my drive/dropbox/s3 cloud from where you can grab a copy of the file, if you are interested.

I am not an expert by any definition of the term. Most of the code is likely to be naive and n00bish. Also, don't submit pull requests. I am doing this to learn for myself. Feel free to fork and own the code.
